# TextFile
A basic Java Library which constructs a text file and supports various different methods to filter and edit said text file.

Far from exhuastively useful but works. Not optimized. For example. the findAllLines() method when searching for a given string will search by char using the contains() method. In a future update i'll optimise this perhaps but this was more of a project just prove my capabilities a little while i do my academics. 

You're free to use but I don't know why you would want to. There are way better alternatives.

May update in the future.
